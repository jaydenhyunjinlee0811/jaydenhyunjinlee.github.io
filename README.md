## Projects
### E-Commerce Cloud Streaming pipeline - [Repository](https://github.com/jaydenhyunjinlee0811/ECommerceStreamingPipeline)
Tech Stack - Python, AWS S3, AWS DynamoDB, AWS Lambda, AWS Kinesis

This project demonstrates a cross-platform ETL/ELT data pipeline designed to move processed data from a client machine into AWS cloud storage systems. The pipeline ingests two types of mock datasets - _user survey data_ and _invoice transaction data_ â€” applies transformations, and then routes them through an AWS REST API endpoint into a Kinesis Data Stream. From there, AWS Lambda functions process and load the data into DynamoDB (for user records) and S3 (for invoice records).

### GoodmorningToYou - [Repository](https://github.com/jaydenhyunjinlee0811/Goodmorningtoyou)
Tech Stack: Python(Pandas, Flask, boto3), MiniO, Docker, PostgreSQL

This project is a simple web application that helps users start their day with fresh news and historical insights. It collects data from open-source APIs (NewsAPI and OnThisDay), stores it in a locally hosted object store (MinIO), processes and cleans the data, and loads it into a PostgreSQL database. The processed results are then displayed on a lightweight Flask-based web UI.
